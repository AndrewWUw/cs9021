 * Description: Takes as command line argument a nonnegative int N followed    *
 *              by at least N+1 characters, builds a linked list from these    *
 *              characters, and modifies this list so that it starts with the  *
 *              (N+1)st node A and is followed by every second node, moving    *
 *              backwards and wrapping around, followed by the node preceding  *
 *              A again followed by every second node, moving backwards and    *
 *              wrapping around.                                               *
