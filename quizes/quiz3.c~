 *              represented as a dot                                           *
 *               - preceded by between 1 and 20 digits equal to 0, 1 or 2,     *
 *                 the first of which is not 0 and is possibly preceded by     *
 *                 + or -, and                                                 *
 *               - followed by between 0 and 10 digits equal to 0, 1 or 2.     *
 *               Outputs a representation of this number in base 10            *
 *               and in base 2.                                                *
